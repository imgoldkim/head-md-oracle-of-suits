2. Sound as a medium to play (tactile) 

Being able to read cards that look identical is a highly visual form of information processing. What if the game were played using senses other than sight? It could offer visitors a completely new experience.

똑같이 생긴 카드를 읽을 수 있다는 것은 매우 시각적 정보처리 방식이다. 시각을 제외한 다른 감각으로 게임을 플레이 하는 것은 어떨까? 방문자에게 새로운 경험을 선사할 수 있을 것이다.

What if the cards were made using a drawing method with only paper and needle?

## In Imperfect Hands
Humans seek to know their fate and predict the future to escape the incompleteness they carry. Why do people stay up all night in casinos? Why do they keep betting and chasing dreams? What if you stepped beyond your usual way of seeing and played in a new way?
Let’s embark on a new journey, moving beyond judgment through vision—the primary human sense—by using the other senses we possess.

인간은 본인이 가진 불완전에서 벗어나기 위해서 운명을 알고 싶어하고, 미래를 예측하고 싶어한다. 카지노에서 밤을 새는 이유는 무엇인가? 계속해서 돈을 걸고 꿈을 꾸는 이유는 무엇인가? 당신이 가진 시각을 벗어나 새롭게 플레이를 걸어보는 것은 어떤가? 
인간이 가진 감각을 이용해서 primary sensation 인 시각으로 판단하는 것에서 벗어나 새로운 여정을 걸어보자.
